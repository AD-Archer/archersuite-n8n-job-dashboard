Ensure that the code is well-structured, follows best practices, and is easy to read. Use meaningful variable names, consistent indentation, and appropriate comments where necessary.
Avoid unnecessary complexity and strive for simplicity in your solutions. If a problem can be solved in multiple ways, choose the simplest approach that meets the requirements.
When writing functions or methods, ensure they have a single responsibility and are not overly long. Aim for functions that are concise and focused on a specific task.
Use version control effectively. Commit changes frequently with clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of the changes made. This helps in tracking the evolution of the codebase and makes it easier to understand the history of changes.
Write unit tests for your code to ensure that it behaves as expected.

Ensure all code is useable on all devices, mobile and desktop, and that it is responsive.
Use comments judiciously to explain complex logic or important decisions in the code. However, avoid redundant comments that simply restate what the code is doing.
Keep security in mind. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information, validate user inputs, and follow best practices
