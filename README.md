### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL database
- n8n instance (for automated job searching)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AD-Archer/archersuite-n8n-job-dashboard.git
cd archersuite-n8n-job-dashboard
```

2. Install dependencies:

```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Configure your database connection in `.env.local`:

```

5. Run database migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

6. Start the development server:

npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3508](http://localhost:3508) to view the application.

**Note**: This application runs on port 3508 by default to avoid conflicts with other Next.js applications.

## API Endpoints

The application provides several endpoints for n8n workflow integration:

### Job Management
- `POST /api/n8n/jobs` - Create jobs from n8n workflow
- `GET /api/jobs` - Get all jobs
- `GET /api/jobs/[id]` - Get specific job
- `PUT /api/jobs/[id]` - Update job status

### Search Configuration
- `GET /api/search-configs` - Get all search configurations
- `POST /api/search-configs` - Create new search configuration
- `GET /api/n8n/jobs` - Get search configs for n8n (formatted for workflow consumption)

### Utilities
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint
- `POST /api/generate-linkedin-url` - Generate LinkedIn search URLs from criteria

## n8n Workflow Integration

This dashboard is designed to work with the included n8n workflow that:

1. **Fetches your resume** from a specified endpoint
2. **Reads search configurations** from the dashboard API
3. **Scrapes LinkedIn** job listings based on your criteria
4. **Analyzes jobs with AI** (Gemini/GPT) to score resume matches
5. **Generates cover letters** automatically
6. **Stores results** in your database via the dashboard API
7. **Sends notifications** for high-scoring matches

### Sample n8n Workflow

A complete n8n workflow template is included in the repository. Import `LinkedIn Job Search Auto-Match Resume with GPT_Gemini + Cover Letter Generator & Telegram Alerts.json` into your n8n instance.

## Database Schema

The application uses Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL. Key entities:

- **Jobs**: Stores job listings with AI scores and cover letters
- **SearchConfig**: Manages job search criteria and filters
- **User sessions**: Simple authentication for dashboard access

## Environment Variables

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# Optional: Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3508"

# Optional: AI Integration
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
```

## Deployment

### Using PM2 (Recommended for VPS)
